Hi! I'm Yanuo (Arnold) Zhou (周亚诺), a Researcher and ML Engineer specializing in AI for health, drug discovery, and digital phenotyping. I recently defended my MSc thesis in Precision Health and Medicine at the National University of Singapore.

I am actively seeking **Research Associate (RA) and PhD opportunities** to advance AI-driven innovations in biomedicine and precision health.

## Research Interests

- **AI for Health (AI4Health)**: Applying machine learning to healthcare challenges, from digital phenotyping to drug discovery and precision medicine.
- **AI-Driven Drug Discovery (AIDD)**: Graph neural networks for drug-disease link prediction and repurposing using biomedical knowledge graphs.
- **Digital Phenotyping & Wearable Sensing**: ML models for continuous health monitoring, circadian rhythm analysis, and behavioral pattern recognition from wearable devices.
- **Bioinformatics & Omics Analysis**: RNA-seq biomarker discovery, pathway enrichment, and cross-cohort validation for precision health.
- **Biomedical Signal Processing**: Real-time physiological signal analysis (ECG, EEG) with embedded systems and sensor fusion.
- **Wearable Non-Invasive Diagnosis & Therapeutics**: Developing wearable biosensors and microfluidic devices for real-time health monitoring and point-of-care diagnostics.

## Current Work

I'm currently engaged in cutting-edge AI and health research:

- **LitScribe - Academic Synthesis Engine** (2026-present): Building an autonomous literature review system using Model Context Protocol and multi-agent architecture for deep cross-paper synthesis and gap analysis.
- **Multimodal Depression Detection** (2025-present): Digital biomarker discovery combining passive smartphone sensor data achieving 76.2% AUC-ROC.
- **PrimeKG-RGCN Drug Discovery** (2025-present): Implementing relational graph convolutional networks for drug-disease link prediction using biomedical knowledge graphs, with GPU-accelerated processing and attention visualization.

## Key Technical Skills

**AI/ML**: PyTorch • PyTorch Geometric • scikit-learn • GNN (RGCN) • CNN (U-Net) • Bayesian Optimization  
**Bioinformatics**: RNA-seq • Knowledge Graphs (PrimeKG) • KEGG Enrichment • NGS Pipelines  
**Signal Processing**: Wearable Sensors • ECG/EEG • Multi-sensor Fusion • Real-time Processing  
**Reproducibility**: Git • Docker • Config-driven Experiments • HPC • Audit-ready Workflows

## Selected Awards

- 🏆 PRECISE Scholarship, National University of Singapore (2023)
- 🥉 3rd Prize, 10th National Student Optoelectronic Design Competition (2022)
- 🥈 2nd Prize, 8th National Student Optoelectronic Design Competition (2020)
- 🥈 Silver Award, 12th "Challenge Cup" Jiangxi Student Entrepreneurship Competition (2020)
