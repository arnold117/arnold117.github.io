Hi! I'm Yanuo (Arnold) Zhou (周亚诺), a Researcher and ML Engineer building multi-agent systems and AI applications for health and biomedicine. I hold an MSc in Precision Health and Medicine from the National University of Singapore.

I am actively seeking **PhD opportunities** to advance AI-driven innovations in biomedicine and precision health.

## Research Interests

- **AI Agents & LLM Applications**: Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph and GraphRAG for autonomous scientific workflows, knowledge synthesis, and literature review.
- **AI for Health (AI4Health)**: Applying machine learning to healthcare challenges, from digital phenotyping to drug discovery and precision medicine.
- **Digital Phenotyping & Wearable Sensing**: ML models for continuous health monitoring, circadian rhythm analysis, and behavioral pattern recognition from wearable and smartphone sensors.
- **Bioinformatics & Multi-Omics**: Multi-evidence integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics for biosynthetic pathway gene discovery; RNA-seq biomarker identification.
- **AI-Driven Drug Discovery (AIDD)**: Multi-architecture GNN benchmarking for drug-disease link prediction and repurposing using biomedical knowledge graphs.
- **Biomedical Signal Processing**: Real-time physiological signal analysis (ECG, EEG) with embedded systems and sensor fusion.

## Current Work

- **LitScribe - Academic Synthesis Engine** (2026-present): 7-agent LangGraph system with GraphRAG for autonomous literature review. Produces 24-paper reviews with 100% citation grounding in 15 min at $0.098. 272 tests, multi-language support, 5 citation styles.
- **PrimeKG GNN Drug Discovery** (2025-present): 6-architecture GNN benchmark (GAT, RGCN, GIN, GraphSAGE, GCN, MLP) on PrimeKG. V2.0 with data leakage fix (71.5%→0%), GAT best at 0.9866 AUC-ROC under strict hard-negative evaluation.
- **Multi-Omics AE-GNN** (2025-present): 5-stage pipeline for biosynthetic pathway gene discovery. Dual autoencoders (545M params) + GAT with multi-evidence ranking across 132K genes × 7K metabolites.
- **Multimodal Depression Detection** (2025): Behavioral biomarker discovery from smartphone sensors (GPS, app usage, communication, activity). 76.2% AUC-ROC identifying digital phenotypes for mental health.

## Key Technical Skills
