Hi! I'm Arnold Zhou (周亚诺), a researcher focused on applying machine learning to digital phenotyping, wearable sensing, and understanding the effects of light on human health.

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of:
- **Machine Learning for Digital Phenotyping**: Developing computational methods to characterize health and behavior from digital data
- **Wearable Sensing**: Leveraging wearable devices to capture continuous physiological and behavioral signals
- **Light & Health**: Understanding how light exposure patterns impact human well-being and circadian rhythms

## Current Work

I'm currently working on projects that use machine learning to:
- Analyze light exposure patterns from wearable sensors
- Develop predictive models for health outcomes based on digital phenotypes
- Create tools for personalized health monitoring and intervention
