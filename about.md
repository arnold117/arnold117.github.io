## Hello! I'm Arnold 👋

I'm a researcher and engineer passionate about leveraging **machine learning** to understand human health and behavior through **wearable sensing** and **digital phenotyping**. Currently, I'm working as a Research Assistant at **TUMCREATE** (Technical University of Munich), where I focus on developing AI-driven methods to analyze light exposure patterns and their impact on human well-being.

I hold a **Master of Science** from the **Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine** at the **National University of Singapore** and a **Bachelor of Engineering** from **Nanchang Hangkong University**.

### Research Interests

My work sits at the intersection of:
- **Digital Phenotyping** — using sensors and data to characterize behavior
- **Wearable Technology** — spectral sensors, IMUs, physiological monitors
- **Light & Health** — understanding circadian rhythms and environmental impacts
- **Graph Machine Learning** — applying GNNs to biomedical knowledge graphs

### Beyond Research

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll find me:
- 🎵 Listening to classical music (especially Mozart and Liszt)
- 🎧 Exploring HiFi audio equipment
- 🚴 Cycling on open roads
- 📚 Reading across various genres
- 🛠️ Tinkering with electronics and software

### Get in Touch

I'm always interested in collaborating on projects related to wearable sensing, digital health, or machine learning. Feel free to reach out!
