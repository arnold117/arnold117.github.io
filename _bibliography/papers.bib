  abstract = {Sweat sensor has become one of the most important developing directions of in vitro wearable diagnostic device in recent years. Stable sweat collecting device is the key to realize sweat component analysis. In order to ensure that the collected sweat is not subject to component analysis errors caused by evaporation or environmental pollution, mechanical micro-valves were adopted for microfluidic sweat collection devices to realize sealed storage of sweat. However, this poses a challenge to the stability of machining and reusability of the acquisition device. In this work, the Tesla valve without any mechanical structure were introduced into the design of sweat collection chip. And made full use of its diodicity to improve the collection to a certain extent, prevent backflow at the entrance, and restrain the flow at the exit to contact with the outside world. In addition, through optimizing the shunt angle, branch channel parameters of Tesla valve, boosted its diodicity under low flow rate. Furthermore, a sweat storage chamber with baffle structure that can achieve maximum static storage area was adopted to form a whole sweat collection chip. The design was verified through the flow experiment of methylene blue and methyl red indicators on the chip. Through modification of the filter paper fixed in the collection chamber, the colorimetric analysis of glucose and pH was realized. This device may provide new inspirations for the development of wearable sweat sensor.},
