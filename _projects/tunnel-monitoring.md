## Overview

Fluorescence-based fire safety monitoring system for buildings and tunnels, using optical fiber sensor networks to detect temperature and humidity changes. Leverages existing fluorescent coatings as dual-purpose ambient lighting and sensing elements for distributed, real-time monitoring without structural modifications.

## Problem Statement

Traditional fire monitoring has limited coverage (blind spots), environmental sensitivity (moisture, EMI), slow manual inspection (inefficient for 10s-100s km tunnels), and high maintenance costs. Fluorescence sensing offers electromagnetic immunity, superior temperature/humidity sensitivity, and distributed deployment via optical fibers.

## Methodology

### Fluorescence Sensing System
- **Optical Path**: Laser (45° incidence) → Dichroic filters → Fluorescent materials (rare-earth/thymol coatings) → Photodetectors (CCD/CMOS)
- **Signal Processing**: Intensity ratio calculation, spectral peak/centroid shift detection → mathematical transformation to temperature/humidity
- **Control**: Computer-based monitoring center, real-time visualization, alert system

### Fire Detection Logic
- **Alert Level 1**: Temperature rising + humidity decreasing → Potential fire (notify personnel)
- **Alert Level 2**: Rapid temp increase + rapid humidity decrease → Confirmed fire (emergency response)
- **Escalation**: Failed intervention → Multi-channel alerts (popup, alarm, broadcast, SMS)

## Results

**System Capabilities**:
- Distributed monitoring across optical fiber networks
- Multi-parameter sensing (temperature, humidity, trend analysis)
- Electromagnetic interference immunity
- Dual-purpose fluorescent coatings (lighting + sensing)

## Applications

**Target Deployments**:
- Public spaces (malls, transportation hubs, sports venues, hospitals)
- Critical infrastructure (airports, power plants, government facilities, chemical plants)
- Tunnels and underground infrastructure
- High-rise buildings and historical structures

**Market**: ~300,000 hazardous chemical units in China with substantial fire safety demand
