## Overview

A course-based research project conducted at NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, focusing on identifying psychiatric biomarkers for suicide risk in depression using machine learning and RNA-seq data.

## Problem Statement

Depression is a complex psychiatric disorder with heterogeneous presentations. Suicide risk stratification requires:
- Robust, clinically relevant biomarkers
- Cross-cohort validation to ensure generalization
- Integration of statistical and biological significance
- Reproducible ML workflows for clinical applicability

## Key Achievements

- **RNA-seq count-level models** with external cohort validation
- **Cross-cohort validation** demonstrating model robustness
- **4-class to binary mapping** for clinical decision-making
- **KEGG pathway enrichment** linking biomarkers to biological mechanisms
- **Model screening criteria** (CV < 0.5) ensuring robust generalization

## Methodology

### Data Analysis
- GEO cohort integration and preprocessing
- Imbalanced learning (SMOTE-Tomek) for class balance
- Feature selection and KNN imputation
- External validation workflows

### Biomarker Discovery
- RNA-seq count data modeling
- Pathway enrichment analysis
- Clinical outcome mapping
- Longitudinal validation

### Results
- Identified key biomarkers: NR3C1a, HSPA1B
- Cross-cohort AUC > 0.8
- KEGG pathways: Glucocorticoid signaling, Heat shock response
