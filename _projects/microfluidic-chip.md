## Overview

Microfluidic concentration gradient chip using Dean vortex secondary flow mixing for rapid drug susceptibility testing. Reduces mixing length to 1/3 of traditional methods (12mm → 4mm) via lateral elliptical protrusions on channel sidewalls, enabling high-throughput antimicrobial resistance detection.

## Problem Statement

Traditional microbial drug susceptibility testing requires 24-72 hours, large sample volumes, and manual preparation, leading to reproducibility issues and delayed treatment decisions. Concentration gradient variability further complicates accurate MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) determination.

## Methodology

### Equivalent Circuit Design
- Flow resistance in microchannels modeled as electrical circuits (Kirchhoff's laws)
- Optimized network creates 6-outlet gradients (C₀=0 to C₅=1)
- Simplified channel design reduces length and pressure drop

### Dean Vortex Mixing
- **Innovation**: Semicircular protrusions (50-100 μm radius) on sidewalls generate Dean vortex
- **Efficiency**: 1/3 mixing length of straight channels (4mm vs. 12mm)
- **Staggered distribution**: Alternating protrusions maximize flow disturbance
- **CFD Validation**: Computational fluid dynamics verified concentration distribution

## Results

**Performance**:
- Mixing length reduced by 67% (12mm → 4mm)
- 6-level concentration gradients generated
- Channel dimensions: 50-200 μm width, 50-200 μm depth
- CFD-validated pressure drop and concentration uniformity

## Applications

- Rapid antimicrobial resistance detection and MIC determination
- High-throughput drug screening (dose-response analysis)
- Chemotaxis assays and cell migration studies
- Enzyme kinetics and protein-ligand binding studies
- Toxicity evaluation and environmental monitoring
