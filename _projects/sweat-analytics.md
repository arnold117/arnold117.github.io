## Overview

A national innovation project developing a wearable optical sweat collection and analysis device, combining microfluidic engineering with advanced signal processing for real-time biomarker detection.

## Background & Motivation

Sweat is a rich source of biomarkers but is challenging to collect and analyze:
- Non-invasive continuous monitoring opportunity
- Time-varying biomarker concentrations reflect dynamic health states
- Traditional methods require complex lab infrastructure
- Need for point-of-care wearable solutions

## Key Achievements

- **3rd Prize** - 10th National Student Optoelectronic Design Competition (2022)
- **Talanta Q1 Journal Publication** - Peer-reviewed high-impact venue
- **NCHU 'Three Small Projects' Award**
- **Funded by Outstanding Young Scientist Project** (20192BCB23011)

## Technology Stack

### Hardware Design
- **Tesla valve-based sweat collection** - Passive, valve-assisted collection without external pump
- **Microfluidic channel optimization** - Enhanced sweat concentration and isolation
- **RGB colorimetry detection** - Cost-effective optical sensing without specialized equipment

### Signal Processing
- Real-time optical signal acquisition
- Color space transformation and normalization
- Biomarker concentration inference from RGB values
- Multi-wavelength analysis for specificity

## Results

- Successfully demonstrated Tesla valve operation and reliability
- RGB color signals correlated with known biomarker concentrations
- Wearable prototype validated in lab and field conditions
- Comparable accuracy to bench-top methods with 100× cost reduction
